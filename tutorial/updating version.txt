updating textures:

go to your %appdata%\.minecraft\versions folder and open the version folder you want medieval survival to use. paste in MedievalSurvival/data/version/yourversionname.jar
now delete the 'currentversion' folder and make it again by extracting the .jar file to it.
copy the jar file to the 'other' folder.
change file name of the jar file in data/version to currentversion.zip.

updating sounds:
download the extractor from
https://github.com/Ravbug/MCSoundsExtractor/releases

and execute it.

choose the highest number if you want the latest version. for me, it's '17'. the versions can be found in %appdata%/.minecraft/assets/indexes. open the file and checks if it contains the sounds you want.
extract the sounds to medievalsurvival/data/version/currentversion/assets. it will extract the sounds to the assets/minecraft/sounds folder.
