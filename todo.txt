convert futures and waiting to std::latch and std::atomic_bool
make sure textures are loaded only once
json recipe reading should use name for output slot, not index
recipes should be mirrorable
when turning shadows off in the sky, sky rendering suddenly is way faster

mouse input glitchy
add trampling crops
you pick a double stack, even when clicking once with right mouse button
make textures load only when used

prio:
shift click -> craft, move items

add climbing (more important because 2d)
spiders -> string
effects not visible on hunger bar
add respawn screen with spectator mode after death
rename mob::serializeValue to serialize
add wind sound back
block updates not working properly with leaves
giant mushrooms don't drop items
fences don't burn as fuel
make top part of door transparent for light, bottom part not
settings screen at start menu
placing bed still breaks block. luckily, chests drop their loot.
a zombie spawned a few blocks next to a torch in a cave.
stack grabbing outside of creative mode
back to title screen -> no music
charachter not rendered in inventory
do mobs get in boats when touching one?
movement is weird on ladders, and when leaving them you get launched off
sheep and cows should be able to eat grass
composter not usable
items remain in inventory crafting grid sometimes
items following you, even when you can't pick them up
crops should need water
explosion knockback?
hoeing a block works from below too
digging blocks below you when sneaking can make you float
when placing blocks, the whole block get checked for collision, not the hitbox of the block to place
falling blocks can be stuck in the air and 'colliding with the ground' somehow and instantly turning back into falling blocks. 2 falling blocks are stuck inside eachother. speed builds up to crazy amounts.
eggs should be heavier
zooming out using f + scroll also makes inventory slots change
respawn point not set when clicking on a bed at daytime
furnace still smelting when another item is in the smelting slot
mipmapping not working 100% (when zooming out, it darkens, which probably means more transparency)
caves should spawn more often and different types of caves should spawn
enderman getting angry sound playing like 5 ticks in a row 
feather falling should reduce falling speed

nights seem to be very long when sleeping
rails are invisible
chest are rare in mineshafts
spawners spawn without chests in mineshafts
anvil addstack not implemented?
left hand slot
baby mobs should play sound at higher pitch
double chest
armor textures aren't transparent: iron helmet, iron boots
but iron leggings are.
food isn't displayed in halfs
sounds cut out when outside hearing range, which means that falloff isn't correct
pollen stuck at chunk border
teleportondamageai should not make the enderman stand still
landing gravel sound

join server: didn't ask for internet permissions -> lag for some time -> crash
ip + port: can't convert to valid ip adress
dropping items should be dragging outside of inventory
better sounds using equalizing and other audio tricks (for example in caves)
icon not showing

very low prio:
copper (smaller amounts)

done:
add treshold when (wind) force exceeds pushing limit
you can fly out of your bed when the wind blows upward fast enough
glowstone doesn't glow
eggs should spawn chickens
do flowers spread pollen?
lag
xp orbs get influenced by wind too much
improve baby mob spawning by using fitexpandinghitbox
furnace doesn't render burning process
rename tooldrop to tooldropcondition
mobs should stay at one spot for longer
change particle size based on type
why does every entity constructor have to take dimension and position arguments?
when we don't take dimension and position, we can add a particle argument without much cost.
right mouse button takes whole stack
luring mobs with food

optimization ideas for shadow brush:
- calculate weight difference per step somehow
- convert to matrix (position -> color)
interpolators -> one array
maybe byte manipulation? for bilinear interpolation
or colorf
we don't store references to positions for now, because the type of input might change

with a certain command, you can enable each mob to tell what it's doing
