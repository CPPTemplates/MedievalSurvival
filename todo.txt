eggs should be heavier
zooming out using f + scroll also makes inventory slots change
respawn point not set when clicking on a bed at daytime
furnace still smelting when another item is in the smelting slot
mipmapping not working 100% (when zooming out, it darkens, which probably means more transparency)
caves should spawn more often and different types of caves should spawn
enderman getting angry sound playing like 5 ticks in a row 
feather falling should reduce falling speed
dogs hit you back instantly when you crit kill them
use biome.json files to determine spawn chances and music
add ambient sounds using biome.json https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ambience

compilation speed:
move all functions from audio2d to .cpp

nights seem to be very long when sleeping
rails are invisible
chest are rare in mineshafts
spawners spawn without chests in mineshafts
anvil addstack not implemented?
left hand slot
baby mobs should play sound at higher pitch
double chest
but iron leggings are.
food isn't displayed in halfs
sounds cut out when outside hearing range, which means that falloff isn't correct
pollen stuck at chunk border
teleportondamageai should not make the enderman stand still
landing gravel sound

join server: didn't ask for internet permissions -> lag for some time -> crash

dropping items should be dragging outside of inventory
better sounds using equalizing and other audio tricks (for example in caves)

change particle size based on type
why does every entity constructor have to take dimension and position arguments?
when we don't take dimension and position, we can add a particle argument without much cost.
right mouse button takes whole stack
luring mobs with food

optimization ideas for shadow brush:
- calculate weight difference per step somehow
- convert to matrix (position -> color)
interpolators -> one array
maybe byte manipulation? for bilinear interpolation
or colorf
we don't store references to positions for now, because the type of input might change

with a certain command, you can enable each mob to tell what it's doing
